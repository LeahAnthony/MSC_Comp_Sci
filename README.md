Repo for MSc Comp Sci project

This repository contains the full implementation and research code for the MSc Computer Science project titled "From Words to Wins: Predicting Soca Road March Champions Through Lyrics" by Shekeilia Anthony-Rajaram. The project explores the fusion of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and cultural analytics to determine if the lyrical content of soca songs can predict success in Trinidad and Tobago's iconic Road March competition.

# Project Overview
Soca music is central to Trinidad and Tobago's Carnival, with the Road March title awarded to the most frequently played song as bands cross the stage. This project investigates whether lyrical patterns, sentiment, repetition, and rhythm-related phrases correlate with Road March wins using:

1. Text mining & sentiment analysis
2. Topic modeling (LDA)
3. Recurrent neural networks (RNN) with LSTM
4. A custom Kappa Regression algorithm for similarity-based scoring
5. Ensemble methods combining deep learning and Kappa proximity

# Highlights
ðŸ”¬ Novel application of the Kappa Regression algorithm to music similarity analysis

ðŸŽ§ One of the first NLP-focused studies on soca music and Road March success

ðŸ’¡ Practical tool for artists and producers to estimate a songâ€™s "winning potential"
